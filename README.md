# ENTITY-ENLIGHT:UNVEILING INSIGHTS THROUGH EXTRACTION

Entity Enlight is a dynamic web application designed to extract and analyze insights from unstructured text
data. By combining web scraping, file processing, and user input capabilities, it leverages Azure's powerful
Text Analytics services for sentiment analysis and entity extraction. The application allows users to input
data from a webpage URL, upload documents (PDF, DOCX, or TXT), or manually enter text. Once the text
is gathered, it is processed to provide meaningful insights, such as identifying the overall sentiment (positive,
neutral, or negative) and extracting entities like people, locations, organizations, dates, and more.
EntityEnlightâ€™s backend is powered by Azure Cognitive Services, which ensures scalability and accuracy in
handling large volumes of text. Sentiment analysis breaks down the text into smaller chunks and aggregates
the results, providing users with a comprehensive understanding of the emotional tone behind the content.
Additionally, entity extraction categorizes key pieces of information, making it easier for users to identify
relevant details within the text. Whether analyzing online content, documents, or user-inputted text,
EntityEnlight offers a simple, intuitive interface built using Streamlit, ensuring a smooth and efficient
experience.
